I"Æ<p>The objective of this post is to provide an overview of the 3 disciplines of data science and the significance of them. I hope to enable the reader in making a thoughtful decision about the direction of their career after reading this article. Most of the knowledge I have acquired is by working with different people in the industry, reading books and trying to segment the field for easy retention. Although, there is an overlap in how each discipline interact with each other but a lot to be gained by specializing in one of the discipline before branching off to other disciplines. I hope that the reader will be able to get a rough idea on which direction they can target to further their careers.</p>
