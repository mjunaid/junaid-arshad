## Book review: The Society of Mind by Marvin Minsky

Here are the top 10 lessons I learned from reading The Society of Mind by Marvin Minsky. The link to the book can be found [here](https://amzn.to/3xPwfbf). This is a must read for anyone interested in AI or just generally improving their intelligence. Minsky was an American cognitive and computer scientist concerned largely with research of artificial intelligence (AI), co-founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AI laboratory, and author of several texts concerning AI and philosophy. Check out his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky) for more info about his work. The book acts as a great framework to understand how minds work and how intelligence emerges from nonintelligence parts.

Here are my top 10 takeaways from the book that will help you to approach life slightly differently.
