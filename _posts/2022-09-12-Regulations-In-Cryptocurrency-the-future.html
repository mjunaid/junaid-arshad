<p>On June 7, 2022 US Senators proposed a bill to create regulatory framework for digital assets. The full text of the bill can be found <a href="https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Lummis-Gillibrand%20Section-by-Section%20%5bFinal%5d.pdf">here</a>. The bill has to still go through four committees of jurisdiction before it becomes a law. History has taught us that this process could take some time.</p>

<p>This post, provides a quick summary on the key points discussed in the bill and what they mean for the Crypto industry.</p>


<p>Here is a framework to understand what these changes mean:</p>
